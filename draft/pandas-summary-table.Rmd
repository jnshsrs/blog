Because `pandas` is able to work with multihierarchical row and column indicies on a `dataframe` I use it sometimes to summarise a (tidy) dataframe.
Those multihierarchical tables are often used in scientific papers.
Some might argue that they are not tidy, but in my opinion they don't have to, because tidy data is useful in the data analysis process.
However, multihierachical tables can summarise information quite well and therefore are a good way to show your data to a broader audience.

The tidyverse is all about the paradigm of tidy data and therefore makes data processing quite easy, it doesn't have the function of multihierarchical indicies.
Pandas on the other side can handle those multihierarchical tables.
Thats why I use them in one of the lasts steps when it comes to publication.
At that point I have a clear picture of the table I want to present.
After I got that idea, it is easy to use `pandas` to reshape your data in the way you want it to be.
You find an example below.

```{python, engine.path = '/Users/jens/anaconda/bin/python3', echo = T, eval = T}
import feather
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_feather("data/bass_tidy.feather")
# data = data.pivot(index = "country", columns = "term")
data = pd.melt(data, id_vars = ["country", "term"])
# p and q must get column names
# in r the command is spread, the key is term and value is value
data = data.set_index(["country", "variable"]).pivot(columns = "term")
data = data.reset_index()
data = data.pivot(index = "country", columns = "variable")
# df.set_index(['dt','site_id']).pivot(columns='eu')

print(data)
print(type(data))

```

The most interesting part is, that I can create the `pandas` table right in markdown.
You just have to change the r flag at the start of the code chunk to python and maybe you add the `path.engine` in the options and you are good to go.
